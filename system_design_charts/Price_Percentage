MySQL Code:
SELECT 
  Date AS "time",
  ((VOO / (SELECT VOO FROM daily_prices_user1_account2 WHERE Date = (SELECT MIN(Date) FROM daily_prices_user1_account2 WHERE Date >= $__timeFrom())) - 1) * 100) AS "VOO Prices %"
FROM 
  daily_prices_user1_account2
WHERE 
  Date >= $__timeFrom() AND Date <= $__timeTo()
ORDER BY 


InfluxDB Code:
SELECT cumulative_sum("change")
FROM (
    SELECT difference("BAC_MX")/first("BAC_MX")*100.0 as "change"
    FROM "daily_prices_CLG_GBM" 
    WHERE $timeFilter fill(previous)
)
